## Introduction
Insects are a diverse group of arthropods that have adapted to almost every environment on Earth. They are found in almost every habitat, from the Arctic to the tropics, and from the highest mountains to the deepest oceans. Insects play an important role in the environment, providing food for other animals, pollinating plants, and helping to break down organic matter. They can also be a major problem for homeowners and businesses, causing damage to property, spreading disease, and contaminating food.

## Insects
Insects are small invertebrates that have a hard exoskeleton, three pairs of jointed legs, and one or two pairs of wings. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, with over a million species identified. Insects have adapted to almost every environment on Earth, and they play an important role in the food chain, providing food for other animals, pollinating plants, and helping to break down organic matter. They have survived numerous extinction events, including the Permian extinction event, which wiped out over 90% of all species.

## Insect Infestations
Insect infestations can be a major problem for homeowners and businesses. Insects can cause damage to property, spread disease, and contaminate food. Common insect pests include ants, cockroaches, fleas, bed bugs, and termites.

## Insect Control
Insect control is the process of managing and eliminating insect populations in order to reduce the damage they cause. This can be done through a variety of methods, including chemical, biological, and physical control. In addition, understanding the life cycle of insects and their behavior can help to prevent infestations.

## Insect Repellents
Insect repellents are substances that are used to repel insects. They can be applied to the skin or clothing, or used in the form of sprays, aerosols, or candles. Common active ingredients in insect repellents include DEET, picaridin, and lemon eucalyptus oil. Repellents can be an effective way to reduce the risk of insect-borne diseases, as well as the annoyance of insect bites.

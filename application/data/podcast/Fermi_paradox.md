# Fermi Paradox


## Introduction
The Fermi paradox is a thought experiment that questions why, given the vastness of the universe, we have yet to encounter any evidence of extraterrestrial life.

## Aliens
The discussion in the context information revolves around the possibility of aliens existing and the potential implications of their existence. It is suggested that if aliens exist, they may be observing us and making sure we don't blow ourselves up. It is also suggested that if aliens wanted us to know, they could just show up and walk down Main Street.

## Extraterrestrial Life
The context information also discusses the possibility of extraterrestrial life existing. It is suggested that if there is evidence of extraterrestrial life, it would need to be at least as good as a 7-Eleven or ATM cam. It is also suggested that if we were to find something like a cube of titanium in the middle of a pyramid, it would be evidence of aliens as it would be too difficult to make titanium without a computer. Additionally, it is suggested that if we read the geological history of Earth, there have been many extinction events, such as the Permian extinction event, where over 90 percent of all species died out.

## Intergalactic Travel
The context information also discusses the possibility of intergalactic travel. It is suggested that it will take a while to build a real civilization on Mars and that the threshold that really matters is if we have enough resources on Mars such that if the spaceships from Earth stop coming, we could survive. It is also suggested that if we were to encounter aliens, they would have to be very subtle as they would have to be able to travel from one planet to another in a matter of seconds. Intergalactic travel is also seen as a potential way for humans to survive extinction events on Earth.

## Interstellar Communication
The context information also discusses the possibility of interstellar communication. It is suggested that if aliens wanted us to know, they could just show up and walk down Main Street. It is also suggested that if we were to encounter aliens, they would have to be very subtle as they would have to be able to travel from one planet to another in a matter of seconds. It is also suggested that if we were to find something like a cube of titanium in the middle of a pyramid, it would be evidence of aliens as it would be too difficult to make titanium without a computer. Additionally, it is suggested that Spotify is a great way to access the Joe Rogan Experience and watch back catalogue videos, including clips, and switch between video and audio experience.

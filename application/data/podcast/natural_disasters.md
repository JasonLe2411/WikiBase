# Natural Disasters


## Introduction
Natural disasters are events that occur naturally and cause destruction and disruption to the environment and the lives of people living in the affected area. They can range from earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, as well as other events such as meteors, super volcanoes, and extinction events. Each of these disasters can cause significant damage and loss of life, and have been a part of Earth's history for millions of years.

## Earthquakes
Earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface. They can cause significant destruction to buildings and infrastructure, as well as loss of life. Earthquakes can also trigger tsunamis, landslides, and other secondary disasters.

## Hurricanes
Hurricanes are large storms that form over warm ocean waters. They can cause significant destruction to buildings and infrastructure, as well as loss of life. Hurricanes can also cause flooding, storm surges, and other secondary disasters.

## Tornadoes
Tornadoes are powerful rotating columns of air that form over land. They can cause significant destruction to buildings and infrastructure, as well as loss of life. Tornadoes can also cause flooding, hail, and other secondary disasters.

## Floods
Floods are caused by heavy rains or the overflow of rivers and streams. They can cause significant destruction to buildings and infrastructure, as well as loss of life. Floods can also cause landslides, mudslides, and other secondary disasters. Floods have been a part of Earth's history for millions of years, and have caused some of the most devastating natural disasters in history.
